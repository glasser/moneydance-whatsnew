This is a plugin for the cross-platform personal finance tool [MoneyDance](http://www.moneydance.com/) which shows the most recently created (not most recently dated!) transactions as a home page view.  It reminds you where you left off the last time you were working in [MoneyDance](http://www.moneydance.com/).

(It's also the first public example I know of for how to write a [HomePageView](http://moneydance.com/dev/apidoc/com/moneydance/apps/md/view/HomePageView.html).)

While the code is written (and checked into svn as [r1](https://code.google.com/p/moneydance-whatsnew/source/detail?r=1)), it currently hasn't been cleaned up to be releasable.  (Right now, it's just a full copy of the MD dev-kit, with my code added in.)
